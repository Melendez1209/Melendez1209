# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am just an ordinary junior high school student from the Beijing No.5 Middle School Tongzhou Campus, and I am currently
committed to passing the examination and enrolling in the Pilot Pre-cultivation Experimental Class of Beijing No.57
Middle School!

# Apologies

As I have entered the intense and busy life of 9th grade, in order to make sure that I can pass the exams in June next
year without any regrets, I am suspending the maintenance of all my repositories with immediate effect, and I would like
to thank all the developers for their understanding. Of course, no one wants their repositories to suck, so if you're
interested in helping me continue to maintain them, you can still reach me at my email.
